# ReporterReview

A project that takes a look at what reporters publish, and builds profiles based on that. The idea is to identify which reporters publish which articles, thereby creating profiles for each that might show:

- Their general stance (Between Hard-Left, Moderate-Left, Centrist, Moderate-Right, Hard-Right, other)
- Their 'favourite' topic
- Their most used words
- etc.
